        <h1 class="title">Does anyone remember the S.S. Eternal Meridian cruise ship incidents (2004-2005)?</h1>

        <div class="content">
            <p>I'm doing research for my maritime history thesis and I keep finding references to a cruise ship called
                the "S.S. Eternal Meridian" that operated Caribbean routes from 2002-2005.</p>

            <p>What's weird is that the ship was decommissioned extremely suddenly in mid-2005, and there's almost NO
                information about why online. The company (Meridian Luxury Cruises) went bankrupt shortly after and all
                their records seem to have vanished.</p>

            <p>I found a few things through FOIA requests and old forum archives:</p>

            <ol>
                <li><strong>Multiple Disappearances (2004):</strong> At least 3 crew members and 2 passengers vanished
                    during a single cruise in June 2004. Never found. Ship was investigated but allowed to continue
                    operating.</li>

                <li><strong>Maintenance Issues:</strong> Hundreds of complaints about "sounds in the walls," "dripping
                    sounds," and "cold spots" specifically on Deck 3. Company claimed it was just old pipes.</li>

                <li><strong>Final Voyage (Feb 2005):</strong> Ship returned to port 3 days early. Passenger manifests
                    show 47 people checked in, but only 39 disembarked. Company claimed the discrepancy was a "clerical
                    error."</li>

                <li><strong>Abrupt Decommission:</strong> Ship was towed to a scrapyard in Bangladesh within weeks.
                    Demolished by May 2005.</li>
            </ol>

            <p>I also found a weird detail: Several passengers from that final voyage posted on TripAdvisor (before the
                reviews were deleted) about "seeing things in the corridors at night" and "crew members that didn't
                appear on the ship manifest."</p>

            <p>Has anyone else heard about this? Or does anyone have family who worked for Meridian Cruises around that
                time?</p>

            <p>The whole thing feels like it's been scrubbed from the internet.</p>

        <p>My uncle worked as an engineer on that ship for like 6 months in 2004. He quit suddenly and refuses to talk
            about it. When I asked him once, he just said "the pipes knew things they shouldn't know" and changed the
            subject. Thought he was just being dramatic but now I'm not sure.</p>

        <p>OP, check maritime archives in Miami and New Orleans. I've seen similar scrubbing happen with ships involved
            in "incidents" that companies don't want public. Usually it's insurance fraud or major safety violations,
            but the passenger number discrepancy is... concerning.</p>
        <p>Also, Bangladesh ship breaking yards don't keep records. That ship is GONE gone.</p>
