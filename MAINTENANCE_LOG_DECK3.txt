MAINTENANCE LOG FRAGMENT - DECK 3 Engineering

Officer: M. Torres (Night Shift)
Location: Deck 3 - Forward Pipe Access

Standard pressure check on waste water system.
Noticed unusual acoustic resonance in Pipe Junction #37.
Sounds like... breathing? Running water when all valves closed.
Checked three times. No leaks detected.
Pressure nominal.

Probably just expansion/contraction from temperature differential.

Will monitor.

Officer: M. Torres
Location: Deck 3 - Same section

Called back to Junction #37.
Passenger in Cabin 312 (directly above) complained about:
  - "Whispering" in the walls
  - Water dripping sound (no water found in cabin)
  - "Something moving" in the ceiling

I inspected the crawlspace above 312.
All pipes dry. No condensation. No movement.

But the breathing sound is louder now.

And the temperature in that junction is 7°C lower than 
surrounding sections. No explanation.

Moved passenger to Deck 5 as courtesy.
Sealed crawlspace pending daytime inspection.

Officer: R. Hendricks (Day Shift)
Location: Deck 3 - Junction #37 + surrounding areas

Torres left me a note about the "breathing pipes."
Thought he was fucking with me.

He wasn't.

I opened the sealed crawlspace.
The sound is definitely there.
It's not mechanical. It's organic.

And there's something else:

Black substance dripping from Pipe #37-C.
Not oil. Not rust. Not sewage.
It's... thick. Like syrup. But it smells like nothing.

Collected sample in maintenance bucket for analysis.

When I touched it, my fingers went numb for 
approximately 40 seconds.

JUNE 16, 2004 - 01:58
Officer: M. Torres
Location: Deck 3 - ENTIRE FORWARD SECTION

The dripping has spread to 8 additional pipes.
The breathing sound is now audible from the corridor.

Passengers are complaining.

I went back into the crawlspace with thermal camera.
There's a heat signature. Moving. In the pipes.

But pipes don't have anything alive in them.

I saw something through the gap in the ceiling tile.
Pale. Long.
Like fingers.

I'm requesting immediate engineering inspection and 
possible pipe replacement for the entire section.

This isn't normal wear and tear.
